## **Project Proposal:**

*WeFlix is an app designed to help groups of people settle on a movie to watch together. A group is given a shareable link to a survey that will give them a list of questions/preferences for them to select for the movie they are watching. Once everyone has submitted, WeFlix will choose a few movies for them to watch!*
